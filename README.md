# A-multiple-sclerosis-prognostic-index-
Here I have published my R-codes for the analysis in the paper: "Developing a clinical–environmental–genotypic prognostic index for relapsing-onset multiple sclerosis and clinically isolated syndrome"
This paper is available at https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcab288

# Part I: Analysis of worsening of disability (WoD)

1-Compute the CEPI, GPI, and CEGPI using the R-script "1-Analysis of EDSS_Develope the prognostic index.R"

2-Perform dynamic landmark prediction on the prognostic indices using the R-script "2-Analysis of EDSS_Dynamic landmark prediciton using the prognostic index.R"

# Part II: Analysis of recurrent relapsing events (RRE)

3-Compute the CEPI, GPI, and CEGPI using the R-script "1-Analysis of EDSS_Develope the prognostic index.R "

2-Perform dynamic landmark prediction on the prognostic indices using the R-script "2-Analysis of EDSS_Dynamic landmark prediciton using the prognostic index.R"

## Part III: Analysis of relapses and/or worsening of disability (RWoD)

-To perform this analysis, combined the EDSS status (0,1) with relapse status (0,1) and repeat the analysis in Part I and II.
